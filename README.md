# A repository that recorded the contents of courses 

## This course is from Department of Bigdata Engineering SCH Univ. 

- Time-Series Data Course(using R)
  - This course teach me how to explore, preprocess, analyze Time_Series Data.
  - Using R programming, Jupyter notebook
  - I wrote down homework of the course, and hands-on practice analyzing Time-Seires Data.
  
 - Unstructured Data Course(using R)
   - This course teach me how to explore, preprocess, analyze Unstructured Data.
   - Usually using Frequency data. After that, I used Image data.
   - Using R programming, Jupyter notebook
  
 - Machine Learning(using Python)
   - This course teach me the theory of various machne learning models and hands-on modeling on jupyter notebook.
   - But I have recorded hands-on modeling based on contents of lecture.
   - Learnings about machine learning algorithm are presently being posted on <a href='https://techblog-history-younghunjo1.tistory.com'>my own blog</a>
